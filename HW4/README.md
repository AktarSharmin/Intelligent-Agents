This assignemnt implements the D* algorithm in CoppeliaSim using Python. The goal is to find a path from start point to goal point while avoiding obstacles. The simulation environment is scaled to [-2.5, 2.5] (CoppeliaSim) space and safety boundary is used to prevent collisions. 

To run the code, open the HW4_Sharmin.ttt file with CoppeliaSim and use the hw4_script.py code.
