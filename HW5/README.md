This homework extends the HW4 and implements the D* algorithm in CoppeliaSim using Python to move a quadcopter along a predefined path. The environment is scaled to a [-2.5, 2.5] CoppeliaSim space, and a safety boundary is used to prevent collisions.

Files:
HW5_Sharmin.ttt: CoppeliaSim scene file for the project.
path_planning_quad.py: Python script to set up the trajectory.
quad_following_path.py: Python script to move the quadcopter along the trajectory.
README.md: This file.

Usage:
To run the project:
Open CoppeliaSim and load the HW5_Sharmin.ttt scene file.
